# Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a fully managed service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of Kubernetes clusters on AWS. Kubernetes is an open-source orchestration system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## Key Features

- **Managed Kubernetes Clusters:** EKS allows you to run Kubernetes workloads with minimal operational overhead. It integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes ecosystem tools.
- **Flexibility:** Supports both **EC2 instances** (worker nodes) and **AWS Fargate** for serverless containers.
- **Multi-Cloud Compatibility:** Kubernetes is cloud-agnostic, making EKS suitable for organizations transitioning from on-premises Kubernetes or other cloud providers.
- **Regional Deployment:** For high availability and disaster recovery, deploy one EKS cluster per region.

## EKS Components

### Node Management

1. **Managed Node Groups:**
   - Nodes (EC2 instances) are automatically created and managed by EKS.
   - Nodes are part of an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for dynamic scalability.
   - Supports **On-Demand** and **Spot Instances** for cost optimization.

2. **Self-Managed Nodes:**
   - Nodes are provisioned manually by the user and registered to the EKS cluster.
   - Supports **Amazon EKS Optimized AMI** for quick setup.
   - Offers flexibility but requires additional management.

3. **AWS Fargate:**
   - A **serverless** option for running Kubernetes workloads.
   - Removes the need to manage nodes.
   - Ideal for applications requiring high scalability with minimal operational complexity.

### Storage Integration

Amazon EKS supports multiple AWS storage solutions through the **Container Storage Interface (CSI):**

- **Amazon EBS:** Block storage for persistent volumes.
- **Amazon EFS:** Shared file storage, compatible with Fargate.
- **Amazon FSx for Lustre:** High-performance file systems.
- **Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP:** Enterprise-grade storage capabilities.

For optimized storage use:

- Specify the **StorageClass manifest** in the EKS cluster configuration.
- Leverage ephemeral volumes tied to the pod lifecycle for **low-latency workloads**, such as using node RAM for temporary storage.

## Scaling and Performance

Amazon EKS provides robust scaling mechanisms to ensure optimal resource utilization and performance.

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)

Horizontal Pod Autoscaling automatically adjusts the number of pods in a deployment based on observed CPU or memory usage. For example, if an application experiences high traffic and CPU usage increases beyond a defined threshold, HPA will add more pods to handle the load. Conversely, during low traffic periods, it reduces the number of pods to conserve resources. This ensures that applications remain responsive while minimizing resource costs.

>Note: A pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster.

### Dynamic Workload Scaling with Carpenter

Carpenter is a scaling tool for EKS that dynamically adjusts compute resources based on workload demands. It intelligently provisions nodes with the right size and type, such as GPU-enabled instances for AI tasks or memory-optimized instances for data-heavy workloads. As demands change, Carpenter ensures that the cluster has exactly what is needed, reducing waste while maintaining application performance.

### Cluster Auto Scaling with ASG

EKS integrates with Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) to manage the scaling of EC2 nodes. The cluster automatically increases or decreases the number of EC2 instances based on predefined metrics, such as CPU or memory utilization. For example, if multiple pods cannot find space on existing nodes due to resource constraints, ASG adds new instances to the cluster. Similarly, when nodes are underutilized, ASG reduces the cluster size to cut costs. This dynamic scaling maintains high availability while optimizing expenses.

## Security and Access Control

### IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)

- Assign **IAM roles** directly to Kubernetes pods for secure and granular access to AWS resources like DynamoDB.
- Recommended for secure and least-privilege access.

### Taints and Tolerations

EKS leverages taints and tolerations to control the placement of pods within the cluster, allowing for advanced workload scheduling and resource segregation.

- Taints on nodes: Nodes in the cluster can be assigned taints, which act as “repellents” to most pods, preventing them from being scheduled on those nodes.
- Tolerations on pods: Only pods with matching tolerations (that can "tolerate" the taint) can be scheduled on those nodes.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Use **Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights** for comprehensive monitoring of metrics and logs.
- Automatically collects data from EKS clusters, providing real-time dashboards for troubleshooting and performance optimization.

## When to Choose EKS

- For Kubernetes-native workloads requiring extensive control and ecosystem integration.
- When migrating from on-premises or multi-cloud Kubernetes deployments.
- When performance optimization with GPU-based EC2 instances or responsive scaling with HPA is critical.
