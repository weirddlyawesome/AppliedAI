# Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed container image registry that makes it easy to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images on AWS. ECR integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS, simplifying the management of your containerized applications.

## Key Features

### Store and Manage Docker Images on AWS

  Amazon ECR provides a secure and scalable solution to store your Docker container images. It enables developers to easily push, pull, and manage images with just a few clicks, making it simpler to work with containerized applications in the AWS ecosystem.

### Private and Public Repositories

  ECR allows you to create both private and public repositories. Private repositories are fully secured and accessible only to authorized AWS users, while public repositories, such as the [Amazon ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws), allow you to share container images with the broader community. This flexibility enables you to manage both internal and external images with ease.

### Fully Integrated with ECS and EKS

  ECR is deeply integrated with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), allowing you to easily deploy container images to these services without needing to manually handle container image storage or access. ECR seamlessly works with ECS Task Definitions and EKS Pods to streamline container orchestration.

### Backed by Amazon S3

  ECR stores container images in Amazon S3, providing high durability and availability. The underlying infrastructure ensures that your images are highly available and fault-tolerant, offering a secure and scalable storage solution for containerized applications.

### Access Control through IAM

  Access to Amazon ECR repositories is managed through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). You can define fine-grained permissions to control who can push, pull, or manage images within your repositories. This ensures that sensitive container images are accessible only to the right users and services.

### Vulnerability Scanning

  ECR supports image vulnerability scanning to help identify security issues within your container images. By scanning for known vulnerabilities, it enables you to improve the security posture of your containerized applications, ensuring that any potential risks are detected early in the development or deployment pipeline.

### Image Versioning and Tags

  ECR provides support for image versioning and tagging. You can tag different versions of the same image and easily manage and reference these versions when deploying to ECS or EKS. This enables better version control and rollback capabilities for containerized applications.

### Image Lifecycle Policies

  ECR offers image lifecycle policies that allow you to automatically manage the lifecycle of container images within a repository. You can define rules to automatically delete or archive old, unused images based on tags, age, or other criteria. This helps optimize storage costs and maintain a clean, organized image repository.
