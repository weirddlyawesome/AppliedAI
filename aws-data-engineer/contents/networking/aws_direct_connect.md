# **Site-to-Site VPN vs AWS Direct Connect**

## **Site-to-Site VPN**

Amazon VPC offers a **Site-to-Site VPN** connection, which enables you to securely connect your on-premises network to your Amazon VPC over the internet. The connection is based on the **IPsec** protocol to provide encrypted communication between your on-premises network and AWS resources. Here are the key components:

1. **Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)**: The endpoint on the AWS side of the VPN connection. It serves as the AWS counterpart to the Customer Gateway device.

2. **VPN Connection**: A secure link between your on-premises network and your AWS VPCs. The connection utilizes two **VPN Tunnels** for high availability, ensuring that if one tunnel goes down, the other can still maintain the connection.

3. **VPN Tunnel**: An encrypted communication link where data is transferred between your on-premises network and AWS.

4. **Customer Gateway**: The AWS resource that holds the information about your on-premises **Customer Gateway Device**, which is typically a physical device or a software application on your side.

In the case of multiple Site-to-Site VPN connections, AWS provides **VPN CloudHub**, allowing secure communication between different sites (e.g., remote offices) using a hub-and-spoke model. This model can be used for both primary and backup connectivity. This configuration is useful when you have multiple remote offices connected to AWS and want to facilitate communication between these sites without requiring a VPC.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Lower throughput and higher latency compared to AWS Direct Connect, as it depends on internet connections.
- Performance may be affected by external factors like the internet service provider.
- Can be set up quickly and is cost-effective compared to Direct Connect.
- Suitable for environments with low to moderate bandwidth needs.
- Can be used as a temporary solution or backup to other connectivity methods.

## **AWS Direct Connect**

**AWS Direct Connect** establishes a dedicated network connection between your on-premises data center and AWS, bypassing the public internet entirely. This allows for more consistent and reliable network performance, along with potentially lower network costs.

Key characteristics of **AWS Direct Connect**:

- **Private Network Connection**: Unlike VPN, Direct Connect uses a private, dedicated link, which is ideal for applications that require high throughput or low latency.
- **Higher Throughput & Lower Latency**: Direct Connect offers higher speeds, ranging from 50 Mbps to 100 Gbps, and provides a more stable and consistent network experience.
- **No Encryption**: Direct Connect does not encrypt traffic by default. For encryption, you must use the appropriate encryption service, such as IPsec with VPN.
- **Cost & Setup**: Direct Connect involves a higher upfront investment and can take over a month to set up.
- **Combining with VPN**: You can combine **AWS Direct Connect** with Site-to-Site VPN for an encrypted, private connection. This solution offers reduced network costs, increased throughput, and improved reliability compared to internet-based VPN connections.

You can associate **AWS Direct Connect** with either:

- **Transit Gateway**: If you have multiple VPCs within the same AWS Region.
- **Virtual Private Gateway**: If you're using a single VPC.

When using AWS Direct Connect with **VPN** for redundancy, you combine the benefits of private, high-speed connectivity with secure IPsec encryption.

>Note: Setting up direct connect takes a month.
