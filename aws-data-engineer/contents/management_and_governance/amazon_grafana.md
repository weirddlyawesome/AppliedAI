# Amazon Managed Grafana

Amazon Managed Grafana is a fully managed service that provides a powerful platform for visualizing and analyzing metrics and logs from various AWS data sources. Grafana is an open-source tool widely used for monitoring and visualizing time-series data, and Amazon Managed Grafana brings the same capabilities with the added benefits of a fully managed, scalable, and secure service. This service enables you to easily create dashboards, configure alerts, and analyze data from multiple sources, all while simplifying the management overhead.

## Key Features of Amazon Managed Grafana

- **Open-Source Grafana Integration**: Amazon Managed Grafana uses the popular Grafana platform, an open-source tool that allows for customizable dashboards and advanced data visualization capabilities. It supports a wide range of data sources, helping teams to create unified views of their application, infrastructure, and service metrics.

- **User Management**: Integrated with IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) and/or SAML for user authentication, making it easier to manage access permissions across users and teams. This integration helps ensure secure and centralized user management for AWS environments.

- **Scalability**: Amazon Managed Grafana is fully managed and automatically scales to accommodate your needs, whether you're monitoring a few systems or handling data from a large, complex infrastructure.

- **Security**: The service is encrypted both in transit and at rest, ensuring that all your monitoring data remains secure. You can also integrate AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for managing encryption keys, providing enhanced control over data security.

- **AWS Data Source Integration**: The service seamlessly integrates with various AWS services, allowing you to pull data directly from popular sources such as:
  - **CloudWatch**: For monitoring AWS resources and applications.
  - **OpenSearch**: For visualizing logs and search data.
  - **Timestream**: For time-series data, ideal for IoT and operational applications.
  - **Athena**: For querying S3 data using SQL.
  - **Redshift**: For analyzing large datasets stored in Amazon Redshift.
  - **X-Ray**: For distributed tracing of applications and microservices.

- **Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP)**: Grafana integrates directly with AMP for visualizing Prometheus metrics, making it easier to monitor containerized applications, especially in Kubernetes environments.

- **Extensive External Integrations**: Beyond AWS-native data sources, Amazon Managed Grafana supports integration with a wide variety of external data sources such as:
  - **GitHub**, **Google**, **Azure**: For cloud-native monitoring.
  - **MySQL**, **Redis**, **JSON**: For databases and application-specific metrics.
  - **OpenTelemetry**: For collecting and visualizing traces and metrics from microservices.

- **Alerts and Notifications**: Amazon Managed Grafana supports alerts based on your custom queries, helping to keep teams informed about issues as they occur. It integrates with various notification channels, including Amazon SNS, email, and other alerting systems.

## Use Cases

- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Monitor the health and performance of your AWS resources and applications by visualizing metrics and logs.
- **Security Monitoring**: Combine data from AWS CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and other services to monitor security events in real time.
- **Application Monitoring**: Visualize data from Amazon X-Ray and other monitoring tools to ensure application performance and detect anomalies.
- **Log Analysis**: Use Grafana dashboards to analyze logs from Amazon OpenSearch and CloudWatch Logs, enabling real-time log monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Pricing

The pricing for Amazon Managed Grafana is based on the number of active users, the amount of data ingested, and the number of dashboards created. Pricing can vary based on factors such as:
