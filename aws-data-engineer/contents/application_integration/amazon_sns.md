# Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)

Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed **publish/subscribe (pub/sub)** messaging and notification service. It enables decoupling of microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SNS is highly scalable, allowing messages to be efficiently delivered to multiple subscribers or triggered actions across various systems.

## Key Features of Amazon SNS

### Publish/Subscribe Model

- Messages are published to **topics**, which act as a central channel for notifications.
- Multiple **subscribers** can receive messages published to a topic, making it a robust solution for broadcasting updates or triggering multiple actions simultaneously.
- Supported subscribers include:
  - Web servers via HTTP/HTTPS.
  - Email addresses for email notifications.
  - SMS text messages.
  - Amazon SQS queues for queuing messages.
  - AWS Lambda functions to trigger serverless processing.

### Broad Message Delivery

- **Fan-Out Pattern**: When a message is published to an SNS topic, it can simultaneously trigger multiple actions across your distributed system or notify multiple subscribers, making the process efficient and straightforward.
- **Versatility**: SNS supports a wide range of endpoints, ensuring integration with diverse systems.

### Filtering Capabilities

- Attribute-based filtering allows subscribers to **receive only relevant messages**.
- Reduces unnecessary network traffic and processing overhead.

## Usage and Capabilities

### Topic Management

1. **Create a Topic**:
   - A central channel to which publishers send messages.
2. **Create Subscriptions**:
   - Attach subscribers (e.g., Lambda, email, SMS) to the topic.
3. **Publish Messages**:
   - Send messages to the topic, which then distributes them to all subscribers.

### Direct Publishing for Mobile Apps

- SNS supports direct push notifications for mobile applications through platform endpoints.
  - Compatible with:
    - **Google GCM** (Google Cloud Messaging).
    - **Apple APNS** (Apple Push Notification Service).
    - **Amazon ADM** (Amazon Device Messaging).
- Workflow:
  1. Create a platform application.
  2. Register platform endpoints.
  3. Publish messages to these endpoints for mobile notifications.

### S3 Event Notifications

- Amazon S3 can send **event notifications** to SNS topics (e.g., when a file is uploaded).
- Note: S3 cannot directly write data to SNS; it must use event notifications to send messages indirectly.

## Integration with Amazon SQS

- **SNS and SQS** are tightly integrated, providing a decoupled architecture:
  - SNS can publish messages to multiple **SQS queues**.
  - Each SQS queue subscriber can process messages independently.
  - This setup ensures:
    - **Data persistence**: Messages remain in the SQS queue until processed.
    - **Retries**: SQS handles retries for failed message processing.
    - **Delayed processing**: Ability to delay message delivery as needed.
  - SQS subscribers can be added or removed dynamically over time.
- **Access Policies**:
  - Ensure your SQS queue's **access policy** allows SNS to send messages.

## High Throughput and Scalability

- **Subscriptions and Topics**:
  - Supports up to **12,500,000 subscriptions per topic**.
  - Allows **100,000 topics per account**.
- **Message Throughput**:
  - SNS topics offer high throughput, capable of handling millions of messages per second.
  - SNS can support both SQS Standard and FIFO queues as subscribers.

## FIFO Features in SNS

- SNS supports **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** topics, enabling:
  - **Message Ordering**:
    - Messages with the same **Message Group ID** are delivered in order.
  - **Deduplication**:
    - Avoid duplicate message delivery using:
      - **Deduplication ID**.
      - **Content-Based Deduplication**.
- **Limitations**:
  - Lower throughput compared to standard SNS topics.
  - Throughput is similar to SQS FIFO:
    - 300 messages per second (without batching).
    - Up to 3,000 messages per second (with batching).

## Security Features

- **Encryption**:
  - Supports encryption of messages in transit using HTTPS.
  - Integrates with AWS Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption at rest.
- **Access Control**:
  - Uses **IAM policies** and **topic access policies** for fine-grained access control.
  - Policies can restrict access based on:
    - **Source IPs**.
    - **Request timing**.
- **Cross-Account Access**:
  - SNS topics can be accessed across AWS accounts with proper IAM policy configuration.

## Common Use Cases

- **Broadcast Notifications**:
  - Send alerts to multiple systems (e.g., emails, SMS, Lambda triggers).
- **Fan-Out Architecture**:
  - Efficiently distribute messages to multiple SQS queues or Lambda functions for parallel processing.
- **Application Decoupling**:
  - Separate the logic of event producers and event consumers.
- **Real-Time Updates**:
  - Push notifications for mobile apps or system-wide updates.
- **Scalable Triggers**:
  - Trigger multiple downstream workflows simultaneously.

## Advantages of SNS

- **Low Latency**:
  - Notifications are sent in near real-time.
- **Scalability**:
  - Automatically scales to handle high message volumes.
- **Flexibility**:
  - Supports a wide range of endpoints and use cases.
- **Reliability**:
  - Ensures message delivery with built-in retries for failed endpoints.
- **Decoupling**:
  - Reduces dependencies between producers and consumers.
