# AWS Snow Family

The **AWS Snow Family** is a set of physical devices and services designed for transferring large amounts of data to and from AWS in cases where traditional data transfer methods (like the internet) are too slow, costly, or impractical. It is especially suited for environments with **limited connectivity**, high data transfer volumes, or stringent security requirements. **For migrations that take longer than a week, consider using a Snow device**.

## AWS Snowcone

- **Smallest Device**: Designed for portability and ease of use, AWS Snowcone provides **8 TB or 14 TB** of SSD storage.
- **Data Transfer Options**:
  - **Offline**: Ship the device to AWS after collecting the data.
  - **Online**: Use **AWS DataSync** on the Snowcone to transfer data over the network.
- **Edge Computing**: Supports lightweight data collection and processing.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Data transfer from disconnected or remote locations.
  - On-the-go processing of data before transfer.
- **Limitations**:
  - Does not support storage clustering.
  - Best for small-scale data transfers due to its storage capacity.

## AWS Snowball

### Variants

1. **Snowball Edge Storage Optimized**:
   - **Storage**: 80 TB of usable HDD storage.
   - **Compute**: 40 vCPUs and 1 TB of SATA SSD for pre-processing.
   - **Network**: Up to 40 Gb of connectivity.
   - **Use Cases**: Large-scale data transfers, local storage for disconnected environments.

2. **Snowball Edge Compute Optimized**:
   - **Compute**: 52 vCPUs, with optional GPU for machine learning or video analysis.
   - **Storage**: Includes block and S3-compatible object storage.
   - **Use Cases**: Advanced edge computing, data collection, and processing in remote or intermittent-connectivity environments.

### Features

- **Data Transfer**:
  - Transfer data to Amazon S3 buckets; later, use lifecycle policies for S3 Glacier storage.
  - Cannot directly transfer to S3 Glacier.
- **Scalability**: Devices can be rack-mounted and clustered for larger temporary installations.
- **Applications**:
  - Data migration for up to **10 PB** in distributed locations.
  - Temporary compute resources in disconnected or extreme environments.

### Recommended Strategy

- Use **Snowball** to transfer historical data to Amazon S3.
- Employ **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** for real-time data ingestion once historical data is uploaded.

## AWS Snowmobile

- **Exabyte-Scale Data Transfer**:
  - Transfers up to **100 PB** per device.
  - Delivered as a **45-foot ruggedized shipping container** pulled by a semi-trailer truck.
- **Applications**:
  - Massive migrations such as video libraries, image repositories, or complete data center migrations.
- **Recommendation**:
  - Ideal for datasets of **10 PB or more** in a single location.
  - For smaller or distributed datasets (<10 PB), **use Snowball** instead.

## Use Cases for the Snow Family

1. **Data Center Migrations**: Move massive datasets securely and cost-effectively.
2. **Edge Computing**: Process and analyze data in disconnected or remote environments.
3. **Large-Scale Migrations**:
   - Historical data: Use Snowball or Snowmobile for bulk data transfer.
   - Real-time data: Use services like **Amazon Kinesis** after migration.
4. **Hybrid Cloud Environments**: Collect, process, and synchronize data between on-premises environments and AWS.

## Advantages of the AWS Snow Family

- **High Security**: End-to-end encryption ensures secure data transfers.
- **Rugged and Portable**: Devices are designed for durability in harsh environments.
- **Efficient Transfers**: Enable fast, reliable, and cost-effective migration for large datasets.
- **Scalable**: Options available for various data sizes, from a few terabytes (Snowcone) to exabytes (Snowmobile).

The AWS Snow Family provides comprehensive solutions for data migration and edge computing, offering flexible options for diverse data sizes and environments.
