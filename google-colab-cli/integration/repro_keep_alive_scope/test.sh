# Integration Test: Keep-Alive Daemon Soak (OAuth Scope Regression Guard)
#
# Background:
#   The keep-alive daemon would `colab new` successfully but then silently die
#   ~1 minute later, causing the VM to be idle-pruned shortly after. The
#   dominant cause for EXTERNAL users (issue #14, fixed 2026-06-15) was that
#   keep-alive used the RuntimeService RPC at colab.pa.googleapis.com, which
#   requires the caller to be a serviceusage consumer of Colab's internal
#   project 1014160490159 — something no ordinary account is. That returned
#   HTTP 403 USER_PROJECT_DENIED. Keep-alive now uses the Tunnel Frontend ping
#   (GET /tun/m/<endpoint>/keep-alive/ with X-Colab-Tunnel: Google) on
#   colab.research.google.com, authenticated with the user's bearer token and
#   requiring no project entitlement.
#
#   Earlier (2026-04-30) the RPC path also required `X-Goog-Api-Client` to
#   contain `grpc-web` (else 400) and the `colaboratory` OAuth scope (else 403
#   SCOPE_NOT_PERMITTED). Those are moot now but kept here for history.
#   Unit-test layers pass because they mock the network; these bugs only
#   surface against the live backend — which is why this soak test exists.
#
# What this test does:
#   1. Spawns a real Colab session via `colab new`.
#   2. Waits 90 seconds — long enough for the daemon to hit at least one
#      ping iteration *after* the pre-flight (the loop sleeps 60s between
#      pings).
#   3. Reads the structured history via `colab log` and asserts NO
#      `KEEP: error` events were recorded. Any error event means a daemon
#      ping was rejected by the server, which is the regression.
#   4. Verifies the daemon process is still alive.
#   5. Cleans up via `colab stop`.
#
# Cost: ~95 seconds of real wall-clock time + one short-lived Colab CPU
# assignment.
