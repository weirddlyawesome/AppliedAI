# Integration Test: Keep-Alive Daemon Lifecycle
# Verifies that `colab new` spawns a detached keep-alive daemon, persists its
# PID in the session state, and that `colab stop` reaps it cleanly.
#
# This test is a fast smoke test (~10s). For a soak test that verifies the
# daemon's pings actually succeed against the live backend, see
# integration/repro_keep_alive_scope/.
